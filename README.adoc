# Description

This is a continuation-passing metacircular evaluator for the Scheme language,
with support for serializing the state of execution. Implementations are
provided in Scheme (of course), C++, JavaScript and WebAssembly.

It consists of the following components:

Macro expansion::
  Derived forms are expanded to basic forms in link:scm/expand.scm[].

Conversion to continuation-passing style::
  The program is converted to CPS form as decribed https://rawgit.now.sh/davedoesdev/mce/master/doc/dissertation.pdf#page=42[here]. See the `scan` function in link:scm/mce.scm[], which is roughly as described https://rawgit.now.sh/davedoesdev/mce/master/doc/dissertation.pdf#page=46[here].

Executing the CPS::
  The CPS form is executed by repeatedly stepping through its state, as decribed https://rawgit.now.sh/davedoesdev/mce/master/doc/dissertation.pdf#page=56[here]. See the `run` function in link:scm/mce.scm[].

State-saving mechanism::
  The state of the program can be serialized to a string at any point of its execution, as decribed https://rawgit.now.sh/davedoesdev/mce/master/doc/dissertation.pdf#page=48[here]. See the `mce-save` and `mce-restore` functions in link:scm/mce.scm[].

The macro expansion and CPS conversion components are implemented in Scheme.
The CPS execution component has Scheme, C++, JavaScript and WebAssembly
implementations.

# Building

## Scheme

You'll need to install the https://www-sop.inria.fr/indes/fp/Bigloo/[Bigloo]
Scheme compiler to build them. Once you've done that:

```bash
make -C scm
```

You should end up with executables `expand`, `scan` and `mce` in the link:scm[]
directory. `expand` does macro expansion, `scan` does CPS conversion and
`mce` executes the CPS form.

## C++

If you have a modern C++ compiler, then this should work:

```bash
make -C cpp
```

You should end up with executable `mce` in the link:cpp[] directory. This
executes CPS forms produced by `scm/scan`.

## JavaScript

Make sure you have https://nodejs.org/[Node.js] installed and then run:

```bash
pushd js
npm install
popd
```

The CPS execution component is in link:js/mce.js[].

## WebAssembly

Install https://github.com/CraneStation/wasi-sdk[wasi-sdk] to `/opt/wasi-sdk`
and then:

```bash
make -C cpp/wasm
```

You should end with the `mce.wasm` in the link:cpp/wasm[] directory. This is
the CPS execution component. You'll need a WebAssembly runtime to run it,
for example https://github.com/CraneStation/wasmtime[wasmtime].

# Running the examples

There are a number of examples in the link:examples[] directory.

To run, say link:examples/test-loop.scm[], using the Scheme execution engine:

```bash
./scm/expand < examples/test-loop.scm | ./scm/scan | ./scm/mce
```

To run the same example using the C++ engine:

```bash
./scm/expand < examples/test-loop.scm | ./scm/scan | ./cpp/mce
```

And using the JavaScript engine:

```bash
./scm/expand < examples/test-loop.scm | ./scm/scan | (cd js && node -r esm mce)
```

And using the WebAssembly engine:

```bash
./scm/expand < examples/test-loop.scm | ./scm/scan | wasmtime cpp/wasm/mce.wasm
```

Of course, you can write the CPS form to a file so you only have to do it once,
for example:

```bash
./scm/expand < examples/test-loop.scm | ./scm/scan > test-loop.cps
./scm/mce < test-loop.cps
./cpp/mce < test-loop.cps
(cd js && node -r esm mce) < test-loop.cps
wasmtime cpp/wasm/mce.wasm < test-loop.cps
```

# State-saving

The example link:examples/test-state2.scm[] demonstrates state-saving by
serializing a continuation to standard output.

If you run it like this:

```bash
./scm/expand < examples/test-state2.scm | ./scm/scan | ./scm/mce
```

You should see the serialized continuation written to standard output.

You can pipe the output into `./scm/mce`, `./cpp/mce`, `./js/mce.js` or
`wasmtime cpp/wasm/mce.wasm` and it will resume where it left off:

```bash
$ ./scm/expand < examples/test-state2.scm | ./scm/scan | ./scm/mce | ./cpp/mce
0
1
2
3
4
5
save 21774
restore 21775
6
7
8
9
10
```

You can see the continuation was saved here in one process (21774) and restored
in another (21775).

Of course, you can mix and match engines, for example passing state from a
JavaScript engine to a Scheme one:

```bash
$ ./scm/expand < examples/test-state2.scm | ./scm/scan | (cd js && node -r esm mce) | ./scm/mce 
0
1
2
3
4
5
save 22137
restore 22136
6
7
8
9
10
```

or from a Scheme engine to a WebAssembly one:

```bash
$ ./scm/expand < examples/test-state2.scm | ./scm/scan | ./scm/mce | wasmtime cpp/wasm/mce.wasm 
0
1
2
3
4
5
save 1025
restore -1
6
7
8
9
10
```

Note the WebAssembly process ID is always -1 because https://github.com/CraneStation/wasi-sysroot[wasi-sysroot] doesn't implement `getpid`.

# C++ garbage collector

The C++ engine implements a simple stop-and-copy garbage collector:

* Shared pointers are used throughout to ensure data is released when not
  referenced by the program.
* Weak pointers to data that can form cycles (pairs, vectors and lambdas) are
  stored in a global table, indexed by the underlying pointer value.
* When a shared pointer to a pair, vector or lambda is released, the
  corresponding entry is deleted from the table.
* When the number of entries in the table exceeds a certain threshold:
  1. The current computation state is serialized to a string.
  2. All pairs, vectors and lambdas in the table have their contents nulled.
  3. The table is cleared.
  4. The current computation state is restored from the string.

You can change the threshold by using the `--gc-threshold` argument to
`./cpp/mce`. The default value is 100000.

link:examples/test-mem.scm[] can be used to check the garbage collector is
working. It runs in a loop creating cycles.

# IncludeOS service

A service for the https://www.includeos.org/[IncludeOS] library operating system
can be found in the link:cpp/IncludeOS[] directory.

The service uses the C++ execution engine and by default runs
link:examples/test-loop.scm[] but you can change this by setting `TEST_PROG`
in link:cpp/IncludeOS/CMakeLists.txt[].

Assuming you have IncludeOS installed, you can build the service like this:

```bash
pushd cpp/IncludeOS
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
popd
```

and run the service like this:

```bash
boot cpp/IncludeOS
```
